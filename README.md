# HTML Editor
It's an HTML editor.

## Download it
Get it on the [Actions page](https://github.com/aarikpokras/html-editor/actions). I'm too lazy to upload individual releases.

Just something you should look out for, I used the JavaScript `onkeypress` listener for this, so the preview window may be a click or two late. [Info for smart people](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onkeydown.asp)
